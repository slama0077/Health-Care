To ensure Chocoholics Anonymous (ChocAn) runs smoothly, they need to computerize several systems, such as the provider directory, service report system, report controller, and member management system. These systems will be hosted on centralized servers, enabling authorized users to access them at any time. To achieve this, ChocAn will utilize NASs for data storage and management, either through renting or purchasing, which will be maintained on AWS cloud servers. This will allow users to access the systems through terminals connected to the AWS cloud server, which will guarantee reliable and secure access to ChocAn's computerized systems.
