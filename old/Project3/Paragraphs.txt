Task 1 Assumptions:

ChocAnDataCenter class is responsible for managing and processing all information related to members, providers, services, and provided services.
All the data in ChocAnDataCenter is stored in lists, as we don't have any database connection in this project.
Each member report, provider report, and the provider directory will be generated as a string, which can be later written to a file or sent via email.
The billing process is simplified, and we only need to handle storing the billing information in the providedServices list.
The fees are not associated directly with the provider or member classes, as they are part of the services provided.

Task 3 Description:

The ChocAn system design exhibits high cohesion and low coupling, making it a strong foundation for a maintainable and scalable implementation. Cohesion is achieved through focused classes with specific responsibilities, such as Member, Provider, Service, and ProvidedService. The ChocAnDataCenter class acts as a centralized component responsible for managing and processing data related to these entities.
Low coupling is accomplished by minimizing dependencies between classes. The ChocAnDataCenter serves as a mediator, managing relationships between classes and their corresponding data, thus reducing interdependencies and promoting maintainability and extensibility.
In conclusion, this design is effective due to its high cohesion and low coupling, which are key factors in ensuring a robust system. By having purposeful classes and minimizing dependencies, the design lays a strong foundation for the ChocAn system's implementation.
